# 5G-mmwaves-throughput-prediction
This repository focuses on predicting 5G mmWave (millimeter wave) throughput using machine learning techniques. mmWave bands (24 GHz and above) enable ultra-high data rates but are highly sensitive to obstacles and environmental factors. Accurate throughput prediction helps optimize resource allocation, beamforming, etc...
